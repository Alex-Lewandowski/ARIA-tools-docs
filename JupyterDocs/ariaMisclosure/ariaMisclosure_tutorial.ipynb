In this tutorial, we will introduce the concept of phase misclosure as a means of assessing the quality of an interferogram data set. We will then show how the `ariaMisclosure.py` tool can be used to explore the spatial and temporal patterns of misclosure in a data set."

If the misclosure computation shows a systematic trend (e.g., cumulative misclosure increases with time), then the apparent LOS velocities in your timeseries calculation will not represent true ground surface velocities. Various mitigation strategies for this problem can be found in the literature.\n",
